### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of my top 3 labs because, one I had met a great partner and we got along really well. More on the lab was that I felt like it was a great starting point into my coding journey, as I was able to use what I had practice out of class into a Lab. I also felt like these is one the front 
* Lab 7

    Lab 7, was one of my favorite labs as well not only because I also met another great partner. But I had a fun time collobrating with them. We had a lot in common, and we were able to finish through the lab efficently. 
* Lab 10
    
    Lab 10, was on of my favorite labs because again, I had met a new partner and me and this person had a great time together. We were able to communicate super well, and were really efficent. Im glad I met so many great people in this class. What I actually liked about the lab was actually figuring out how to debug the problem me and my partner had with it.
